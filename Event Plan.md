Run Master (RM) is a running carnival we propose. Any master student can attend an RM. A carnival is run on a particular date, in a particular location and only lasts for one day. During a carnival a range of events are offered from the following list:

- Marathon 42.2 Km

- Half Marathon 21.1 Km

- 10 Km Run

- 5 Km Run

- 3 Km Community Run/Walk

  Not all events are run at each carnival. Each carnival is sponsored by a range of companies and organizations.

  Competitors enter via the RM web site. When a competitor initially registers for RM, they are assigned a unique competitor number. Competitor's numbers consist of a C followed by four digits eg C1234.

After a competitor has registered for RM, they will be sent details of each upcoming carnival and the range of events which will be offered. Competitors can log in to the RM site and enter for a particular event within a carnival. Every entry is assigned a unique entry number (e.g., 5678). Using official timing devices at the carnival, RM records the entrants finishing time and their place within the event. These details are posted on the RM result site the day following the carnival.

A major focus of the RM Carnivals is to raise funds for various charities. When a competitor enters an event, they may nominate a charity for which they will raise funds (not all competitors will select a charity for each event they enter). Competitors who have entered an event can also form teams to support their training and run as a group. The first competitor to register a team for a given carnival is assigned as the Team Manager. This team manager can then add other competitors who have entered the carnival to the team. Teams are identified by a unique team name which the manager must select when they first create the team. Team names are unique within a carnival, however, a given team name may be reused by different competitors in a different carnival as teams are recreated for each carnival depending on which competitors have entered an event for the carnival. RM wishes to record, as part of the stored data, how many members are on each team. Teams may also nominate a charity for which they will raise funds, although not all teams will do so. All charities for which funds can be raised must first be approved by RM.

As part of the entry process for a carnival, competitors can purchase a range of carnival specific merchandise such as running gear, drink bottles etc. RM keep track of the current stock of each item of merchandise they make available.

The successful operation of the carnivals depends on a group of volunteers who carry out the various functions leading up to the competition day and on the day itself. People who would like to volunteer for the RM carnivals register on the RM site. Each volunteer is assigned a unique volunteer id - their name, contact address and phone number are also recorded. Volunteer numbers consist of a V followed by three digits e.g., V123. After registering as a volunteer the RM management team contacts volunteers and assigns them a particular role within a particular carnival e.g. timing official, race marshall, first aid, etc. The volunteers are paid a fixed stipend for the carnival they agree to work in (all volunteers regardless of role are paid the same stipend although this can vary across carnivals). Also, in recognition of their efforts, volunteers can purchase carnival merchandise at a reduced rate of 50% of the listed item cost.
